CSC1035: Practical 3 - EPOS system for a small business
====================
This project is a back-end implementation of an EPOS system customised to the needs of our client, 
the owner of the "Tricky Trinkets" shop.

It's a simple system allowing owners of small businesses to carry out transactions such a selling an item and 
generating a receipt, as well as, keeping record of all previous purchases and keeping the stock up to date.

Since it is only a back-end version of the program, all user operations are carried out via the console.
